            Nutrition, nourishment, or aliment, is the supply of materials - food - required by organisms and cells to stay alive. In science and human medicine, nutrition is the science or practice of consuming and utilizing foods.
    </header>
    <p>In hospitals, nutrition may refer to the food requirements of patients, including nutritional solutions delivered via an IV (intravenous) or IG (intragastric) tube.</p>

     <h2 id="top">What is nutrition?</h2>
    <section class="container">
   
  
        <div class="box "><p>As molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics advance, nutrition has become more focused on metabolism and metabolic pathways - biochemical steps through which substances inside us are transformed from one form to another.
        <br><br>Nutrition also focuses on how diseases, conditions, and problems can be prevented or reduced with a healthy diet.
        <br><br>Similarly, nutrition involves identifying how certain diseases and conditions may be caused by dietary factors, such as poor diet <a href="malnutrition.html">(malnutrition)</a>, <a href="food-allergies.html">food allergies</a>, and food intolerances.</p></div>

    <h2 id="med">Dietitian vs. nutritionist</h2> 
    <p>A registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) studies food, nutrition, and dietetics through an accredited university and approved curriculum, then completes a rigorous internship and passes a licensure exam to become a registered dietitian.</p>
    <p>A nutritionist (without the title of an RD or RDN) studies nutrition via self-study or through formal education but does not meet the requirements to use the titles RD or RDN. The two terms are often interchangeable, but they are not identical.</p>

    <h3 >Dietetics</h3>
    <p>Dietetics is the interpretation and communication of the science of nutrition; it helps people make informed and practical choices about food and lifestyle in both health and disease.</p>
    <p>Part of a dietician's course includes both hospital and community settings. Dietitians work in a variety of areas, from private practice to healthcare, education, corporate wellness, and research, while a much smaller proportion work in the food industry.</p>

                            Major food manufacturers employ nutritionists and food scientists.
